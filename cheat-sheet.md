This is my cheat sheet \
pwd is to print aka display working directory \
ls is to list files in a directory \
cd is to change directory \
cd .. is to go back one directory \
echo is so that the computer repeats things back to you 
> is for adding and replacing text to a file 
>> is for adding text to a file without replacing \
cat means concatenate and is for reading the content of text files \
mv is to move a file to a different file: mv file directory \
mdir is to create a directory aka folder \


This is important for GitHub: \
git add FILE NAME \
git commit -m "CHANGES"

To save to GitHub, type: git remote add origin git@github.com: <branfas>/<REPOSITORY-NAME>.git \
Then type: git push -u origin master \
Then when you save a .md file to GitHub, and you want to save further changes, you should type: git push origin master WITHOUT -u 

You don't have to put stuff on GitHub obviously, you can just save on your local machine
